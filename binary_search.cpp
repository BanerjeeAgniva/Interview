Minimize the Maximum Capacity

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another
within d days. The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].
Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order
given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity
of the ship. Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in
all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within d days.

Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] ---> order not changeable , d = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5
days like this: 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 2nd day: 6, 7 3rd day: 8 4th day: 9 5th
day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of
capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7),
(8), (9), (10) is not allowed.

Partition Problem

Given an array ‘arr’ of integer numbers, ‘arr[i]’ represents the number of pages
in the ‘i-th’ book. There are ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to
allocate all the books to the students. Allocate books in such a way that:
1. Each student gets at least one book.
2. Each book should be allocated to only one student.
3. Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of
pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not
possible, return -1.

Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 4 ‘m’ = 2
‘arr’ = [12, 34, 67, 90]

Output: 113

Explanation: All possible ways to allocate the ‘4’ books to '2' students are:

12 | 34, 67, 90 - the sum of all the pages of books allocated to student 1 is
‘12’, and student two is ‘34+ 67+ 90 = 191’, so the maximum is ‘max(12, 191)=
191’. 12, 34 | 67, 90 - the sum of all the pages of books allocated to student 1
is ‘12+ 34 = 46’, and student two is ‘67+ 90 = 157’, so the maximum is ‘max(46,
157)= 157’. 12, 34, 67 | 90 - the sum of all the pages of books allocated to
student 1 is ‘12+ 34 +67 = 113’, and student two is ‘90’, so the maximum is
‘max(113, 90)= 113’.
