# Goal:
The goal of this assignment is twofold:
1. Application of MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling) for dimension reduction.
2. Create a 4D visualization using a Bubble plot.

# Details:
MDS method uses a distance (dissimilarity) matrix to create a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. This method does not care how the distance (dissimilarity) is computed. In this assignment, we will use the distance between different Indian cities and compute a 2D representation and use it to layout the cities using a scatterplot. 

Note that:
- This exercise is simply to show that the low-dimensional representation is meaningful, not to rely on any dimension reduction. We will actually start with Latitude, Longitude data of cities! We will later use this data for Geo-visualization.
- MDS does not have N-S, E-W direction knowledge. So, while it creates a meaningful layout, you have to infer N-S and E-W orientations from the final plot.

# Data Preparation:
1. **Read Latitude-Longitude of Cities:**
   - Read the latitude and longitude data of a few (150) Indian cities from the database [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/in-cities). The CSV data can be accessed directly from that site: [CSV link](https://simplemaps.com/static/data/country-cities/in/in.csv).

2. **Compute the Distance Matrix:**
   - Compute the distance matrix (distance between every pair of cities) using the `distance.distance` method available from the `geopy` Python package.
   Example usage:
   ```python
   import geopy
   from geopy import distance
   D = distance.distance(latlon1, latlon2).km
   ```
   `D` will return the geodesic distance in km between two locations on Earth, where `latlon1` and `latlon2` are the (latitude, longitude) pairs of the two locations.

3. **Create Zone Column:**
   - Create a zone column in the data frame for each city based on its `admin_name` (administrative name). Use the following mapping to assign zones based on `admin_name`:
   ```python
   zones = {
       "North": ['Delhi', 'Himāchal Pradesh', 'Punjab', 'Uttar Pradesh', 'Haryāna', 'Jammu and Kashmīr', 'Chandīgarh'],
       "East": ['Bihār', 'Odisha', 'Jhārkhand', 'West Bengal'],
       "West": ['Rājasthān', 'Gujarāt', 'Goa', 'Mahārāshtra'],
       "South": ['Andhra Pradesh', 'Telangāna', 'Karnātaka', 'Kerala', 'Tamil Nādu', 'Puducherry'],
       "Central": ['Madhya Pradesh', 'Chhattīsgarh'],
       "North East": ['Assam']
   }
   ```
   This mapping is specific to the data.

4. **Use MDS Method:**
   - Use the MDS method available from the `sklearn` Python package (see [MDS documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.MDS.html)).
   Example usage:
   ```python
   from sklearn.manifold import MDS
   mds = MDS(random_state=0, dissimilarity='precomputed', normalized_stress='auto')
   fit_data = mds.fit_transform(distanceMatrix)
   ```
   By default, MDS creates a 2D representation for the data. Therefore, `fit_data` will contain an array of 2D coordinates.

# Visualization:
Create a bubble plot to visualize the 4D data associated with each city, where:
- The 2D positions (the first two quantitative dimensions) are returned by `mds.fit_transform`.
- The population data, which is another quantitative dimension, is available in the original data frame.
- The zone info, a categorical dimension, is generated by the `admin_name` to `zone` mapping.

Note: Unlike Matplotlib, Plotly has a direct way to create a bubble plot using `scatter`. You can refer to [Plotly Bubble Charts](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/) for guidance.
